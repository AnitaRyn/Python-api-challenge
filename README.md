Analysis:
Based on the graphs there is correlation between latitude and temperature. When the latitude increases temperature drops.
On the other hand there is no observed correaction between latitude and humidity, cloudiness or wind speed. Overall, the humidity level seems to be high. 
For cloudiness, there seems to be a lot of variation across all latitudes. Wind speed remains relatively similar across latitudes.
